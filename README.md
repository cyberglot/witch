## Intro

Witch combines different proof strategies to enable users to profit from proof assistants without an in-depth understanding of the theory behind it. Witch achieves this by using algebraic effects and handlers.  The name of this project is a reference to the software wizard.

Thanks to Witch, users can program as they usually do and use the proof environment (a witch) as an effect to prove specific properties of their programs. Moreover, as the proof environment will be used as an effect, it allows combining different automated proof engines and proof styles.
